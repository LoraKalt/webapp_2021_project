## Assignment 2:
Click on the link below to view signup.html page.

OR view in github pages:

[signup.html](https://lorakalt.github.io/webapp_2021_project/signup.html) - Github pages were updated to work specifically on the assignment-2 branch. However if for some reason the specific branch is not being shown, either cache needs to be refreshed or needs to be downloaded to see changes. 


## Design Choices:

Javascript was chosen because it was already being worked on in assignment 1.  Invalid character check is not applied to password inputs or any optional inputs such as location and biography. This decision was made because users may want to use these characters for both location and biography. 

Design decision was made to have the border turn red upon invalidation instead of the background.

## Implementation:
Website uses [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/), html5, css3, javascript
